# CircusCharles
Small assignment for CSC 316
This is my version of a 3D Circus Charlie simply titled Circus Charles. You play as a frog named Charles as he hosts his own circus perfomance. Dodge the balls coming at you by either dodging around, going under, or jumping over. WASD or Arrow Keys to move left and right. Space, W, or up key to jump
