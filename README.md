# CircusCharles
## Small assignment for CSC 316

This is my version of the NES classic Circus Charlie simply titled Circus Charles. You play as a frog named Charles as he hosts his own circus perfomance. Dodge the balls coming at you by either dodging around, going under, or jumping over.

This simple game was created entirely by me and was made with the monogame framework.

## Controls
- A & D or Left/Right arrows to move left and right
- W, up Arrow, or space to jump.
